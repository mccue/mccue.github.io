<h1>Writing and Running Your First Program</h1>
<p>To test that your environment is working as expected, write and execute your first program:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Start PyCharm</li>
  <li>Create a new project and name it <strong>HelloWorld</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/CreateProject.png" alt="images/CreateProject.png"/></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Copy and paste the following lines into main.py:</p>
  <pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Hello World!")
</code></pre></li>
  <li>Click the green triangle to execute your program</li>
</ul>
<p>You should get the following result:</p>
<pre><code>Hello World!

Process finished with exit code 0
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the following items in the PyCharm <em>interactive development environment (IDE)</em>:</p>
<p><img src="images/PyCharmIDE.png" alt="images/PyCharmIDE.png"/></p>
<p>Notice that HelloWorld is a program in a file, main.py. All Python code files have the .py <em>file extension</em>. The program is only 2 lines long. Each line of code is called a <em>statement</em>. Often, we will identify the language <em>syntax</em> (rules) by the kind of statement, e.g. the first line is an <em>if statement</em> and the second line is a <em>print statement</em>.</p>
<p>Even with this simple program there is actually more to discuss later. For now, note that <em>indentation</em> is very important in Python syntax–each <em>block</em> of code must be indented 4 spaces. In this case the block is one line long; it contains the print statement.</p>
<p>If you run the program and the expected output is not displayed in the Python Console, retrace your steps. If that doesn’t help identify the issue, try to use a search engine (like Google) and search for the error you receive.</p>
<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>Submit a screen shot of the IDE after you run HelloWorld and answer the questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What is source code?</li>
  <li>What is syntax?</li>
  <li>What is a statement?</li>
  <li>How can you identify a block of code?</li>
  <li>How many statements are in the shortest block of code?</li>
  <li>How does a computer recognize that a file can be executed by Python?</li>
</ol>
